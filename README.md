## Overview
This is a frontend mentor project built with CSS and JavaScript.

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I learnt plenty of CSS concepts, but a new concept I learnt from this project was how to create a lightbox element. Generally, the project had enough elements that required JavaScript functionality, which was excellent for my learning process.
